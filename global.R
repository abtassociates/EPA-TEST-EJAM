#' dataload_from_pins - download / load datasets from pin board
#' @details 
#'   This does work:
#'   
#'   board <- pins::board_connect(auth = "rsconnect") 
#'   
#'   assuming that credentials are set up for the user doing this.
#'   
#'   This does work:
#'   
#'   board <- pins::board_connect(auth = 'manual', server = Sys.getenv("CONNECT_SERVER"), key = Sys.getenv("CONNECT_API_KEY")) 
#'   
#'   if   Sys.setenv(CONNECT_SERVER = "https://rstudio-connect.dmap-stage.aws.epa.gov")
#'   
#'   and if  CONNECT_API_KEY  was set to the API key created already.
#'   
#'   
#' @param varnames character vector of names of R objects to get from board
#' @param boardfolder if needed to specify a different folder than default
#' @param auth See help documentation for [pins::board_connect()]
#' @param server if needed to specify a server other than default (which might be 
#'   stored in envt variable CONNECT_SERVER or be registered via the rsconnect package).
#'   Note if auth = "envvar" then it looks for CONNECT_SERVER to get name of server which
#'   needs to be the full url starting with https:// - see help for board_connect 
#' @param envir if needed to specify environment other than default
#' @param justchecking can set to TRUE to just see a list of what pins are stored in that board
#'
#' @return a vector of names of objects downloaded if justchecking = FALSE, which excludes those 
#'   already in environment so not re-downloaded and excludes those not found in pin board. 
#'   If justchecking = TRUE, returns vector of names of ALL objects found in pin board,
#'   regardless of whether they are already in the environment, and 
#'   regardless of whether they were specified among varnames.
